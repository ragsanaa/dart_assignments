> #### Description
> The program
> - generates a random number between 0 and 100.
> - generates a list of 10 even numbers.
> - converts given string to base64 url encoded string.
> - shuffles a given list.
>
> #### Example
> ```dart
> Random number between 0 and 100: 42
> List of 10 even numbers: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
> Base64 url encoded string (Hello World!): SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh
> Shuffled list:
> Before shuffle: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
> After shuffle: [4, 2, 5, 1, 3]
> ```
